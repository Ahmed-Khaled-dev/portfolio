          - Automated the generation of release notes when a new GitHub release is created, eliminating manual effort for release notes creation by creating the [<font color="007bff">Release Notes Manager</font>](https://github.com/Ahmed-Khaled-dev/release-notes-manager) using C++, GitHub Actions, Git, and GitHub API.
          - Automated showing contributors how their pull requests will affect the release notes, this aims to enhance the pull requests and release notes descriptions and gives Synfig's pull requests a more professional feel to attract more contributors.
          - Improved accessibility for users by making Synfig easy to use on any Linux distribution by packaging it into an AppImage using [<font color="007bff">bash scripts</font>](https://github.com/Ahmed-Khaled-dev/synfig-appimage) and testing it on 6 Linux distributions.
          - Ensured code quality, maintainability, and clear communication by adding unit tests (doctest), detailed code documentation (doxygen) and sending [<font color="007bff">weekly status updates</font>](https://github.com/synfig/synfig/issues/3377).
